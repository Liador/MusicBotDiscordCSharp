# MusicBotDiscordCSharp

Work in progress, this bot uses Discord.net 1.0.1, no playlist so far, 
but can either play an mp3 stored in local or a stream from youtube
(doesn't recognise which one is which yet but both are working) 

I plan on adding a lot more commands and option when I have some free time.

This bot is for my personnal use but if you have some more ideas, feel free to open an issue.
